A simple CRUD Blog Website built using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. The views were created using EJS.

**Tutorial Credits:** [The Net Ninja](https://netninja.dev/)

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone repository. 
2. In the repository's root directory, run `npm install` to install all required packages.
3. Create a new Database using MongoDB and get its connection string.
4. Create a new .env file in the root directory (or rename the .env_sample file I have provided), and add your MongoDB connection string. 
5. Run the app (nodemon is recommended -- install globally on your machine using `npm install -g nodemon`). Run the app by typing `nodemon app.js` in the terminal when you are in the root directory of the project.
